First you need to have the train and test csv files in rolot directory

Feature Engineering for train set is in - train_features.py
Feature Engineering for test set is in - test_features.py


To run both those files should crate a directoryh as "features" in root directory. Then run above python files. It will create two csv files after feature engineering

To remove outliers run - outliers.py(create "Outliers_Handling" directory in root directory brfor executing outlier.py)
